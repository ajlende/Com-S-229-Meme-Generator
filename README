The SIMP Data Structure
===========================================
TODO: A description of your data structure for storing an image.

The simp data structure consists of a 32-bit unsigned int for the width followed by
another 32-bit unsigned int for the height. Following the width and height is a
pixel** to hold all of the pixels of the image. Each pixel is stored in a structure
with four unsigned 8-bit chars to represent the values of the red, green, blue, and
alpha channels of the pixel. The structure type definitions can be found in simp.h.


Extra Details
===========================================
TODO: A description of any extra details assumed due to ambiguous requirements in
      the project specification.

All files inputted into all programs are assumed to follow the SIMP image format as
described in section 6.1 of the Project 1 Specification.

All file names entered as command line arguments for input are expected to exist.
Non-existent output files will be created, and existing ones will be overwritten.

All numerical values entered as command line arguments are expected to be positive
integers.

In the crop program, the values w + x and h + y are expected to be within the width
and height of the inout image.

In the overlay program, the width of the image to overlay plus x and the hight of the
image to overlay plys y are expected to be within the 


Files
===========================================

README:
-------
This README.


Makefile:
---------
The Makefile contained in the project contains six sections as described below. 
Test files for running commands in sections five and six are contained within two
folders, utils and test which are not included within this tarball. 

1. all command     - This is the default make command to compile all of the
                     programs normally.
2. clean command   - This will clean out any non-source files from the
                     directory.
3. tarball command - This will make a tarball from the source files for
                     submission.
4. debug commands  - This runs all the compiling with the gcc -g flag for gdb
                     debugging.
5. test commands   - These are for comparing the simp output image to the one
                     downloaded from the cs229 website.
6. run commands    - These use the simp files from the cs229 website run the
                     command, and then export a bmp image for viewing.


bw.c:
-----
The bw.c file contains the main method for the bw program.

The bw program converts an image to black and white.

Usage: bw pic.simp out.simp

Each pixel is converted to black and white by averaging the Red, Green,
and Blue values and then setting each color channel to that averaged value.


colorshift.c:
-------------
The colorshift.c file contains the main method for the colorshift program.

The colorshift program performs an artistic color shift in the given image.

Usage: colorshift pic.simp out.simp pattern

The pattern should be one of the following strings:
RGB GBR BRG RBG BGR GRB RG GR RB BR GB BG

The pattern RGB says send Red to Green, Green to Blue, and Blue to Red.
The two-letter patterns swap two colors, such as RG to swap Red and Green,
while keeping Blue the same. 


crop.c:
-------
The crop.c file contains the main method for the crop program.

The crop program performs a crop operation on an image, selecting a smaller
portion to create a smaller image.

Usage: crop picture.simp out.simp x y w h

Overlay creates a new image given by drawing the second picture on top of 
the first picture using a translation such that the top-left corner of pic2
is at the position (x, y) inside pic1.


overlay.c:
----------
The overlay.c file contains the main method for the overlay program.

The overlay program takes two images and places one on top of the other.

Usage: overlay pic1.simp pic2.simp out.simp x y

Overlay creates a new image given by drawing the second picture on top of 
the first picture using a translation such that the top-left corner of pic2
is at the position (x, y) inside pic1.


simp.c:
-------
The simp.c file contains all of the function bodies for the function
prototypes in simp.h.

The functions below relate to reading and writing of the simp file type.


simp.h:
-------
The simp.h header file contains the type definitions for the simp and
pixel data structure as well as the function prototypes that are defined
in simp.c


Extra Features
